                The Wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the little Pig somehow or other; so he said, "Little Pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree."
                "Where?" said the Pig.
                "Down at Merry-garden," replied the Wolf; "and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o'clock to-morrow, and we will go together and get some apples."

            <p>
                Well, the little Pig woke at four the next morning, and bustled up, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the Wolf came; but he had farther to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming down 
                <span id="page16" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>
                <img src="images/img009.jpg" />
                from it, he saw the Wolf coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much. 
                When the Wolf came up he said, "Little Pig, what! are you here before me? Are they nice apples?"
            </p>
            

            <span id="page17" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>
            <img class="color-image" src="images/imgplate-6.jpg" />

            <p>
                "Yes, very," said the little Pig; "I will throw you down one." And he threw it so far that, while the Wolf 
                <span id="page18" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>
                was gone to pick it up, the little Pig jumped down and ran home.

            <p>
                The next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, "Little Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?"
                "Oh, yes," said the Pig, "I will go; what time shall you be ready?"
                <span id="page19" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>
                "At three," said the Wolf.

                So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and 
                <img src="images/img011.jpg" />
                got to the Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he saw the Wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair.

            <span id="page22" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>
            <p>He went to the little Pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.</p>
            <p>Then the little Pig said, "Hah! I frightened you, did I? I had been to the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it, and rolled down the hill."</p>
            <img src="images/img013.jpg" />
            <p>Then the Wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would eat up the little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.</p>

                When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the Wolf was coming down, took off the cover of the pot, and in fell the Wolf. And the little Pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived happy ever after.
