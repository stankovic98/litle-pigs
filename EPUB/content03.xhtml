            <p>The first that went off met a Man with a bundle of straw, and said to him, "Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house"; which the Man did, and the little Pig built a house with it. Presently came along a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in."</p>
            <p>To which the Pig answered, "No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin."</p>
